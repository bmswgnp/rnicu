- The CC2540 BLE USB Dongle was connected to a wall powered desktop. The CC2540 collecting data and sending it over the air was powered by a laptop kept on the lap.

- The sample rate was 400 Hz. A 14-bit ADC with 12 ENOB was used. 0 corresponds to 0 volt, and 8191 corresponds to 3.3v

- Forward gain 6 (inst. diff. amp) x 100 (single ended) = 600
- RLD gain = 200

- Power for the ECG analog interface circuit was provided from the P1.0 pin on CC2540

- The two dry-contact electrodes were pressed approximately across the heart. Both were Hi-Z sensing electrodes. In one of the electrodes, the outer shield was connected to the RLD amp. output.
