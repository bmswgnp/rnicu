- Single CR2032 coin cell battery directly powers CC2540 (DVDD and AVDD)

- Battery -> LP5907 (1.8v regulator) -> ECG circuitry and AREF
- 12 bit (ENOB) ADC used at 400 Hz

- The two dry contact G=1 electrodes are placed across the heart
- Diff gain (6) x Single ended gain (100) = 600
- RLD gain = 200
