- Sampling rate = 400 Hz, 12 bit ENOB. (0 = 0v, 8191 = 3.3v)
- RLD gain = 200
- Forward gain 6 (inst. amp) x 100 (single ended) = 600

- CC2540 directly powered from coin cell battery CR2032
- Electrodes and anlog circuitry are given 2v from REF3320 reference generator IC.

- CC2540, battery, analog circuitry were kept inside the belt.
- Electrodes were out with wires.
- The belt was placed over the belly button with the electrodes on either side of them.
