These recordings were made with the laptop and the entire circuitry on my lap. Consequently, the isolation impedance to earth ground from the circuit common is very large.

- Sampling frequency = 400 Hz
- ADC resolution = 12 bits

- Two electrode differential mode (G=5 inst and G=70 gain. So net G = 350).
- Two layer dry contact electrodes were used.
