- Sampling frequency = 400 Hz, ADC resolution = 12 ENOB
- Gain 6 (diff. gain) x 100 (single ended gain) = 600
- RLD gain = 200

- CR2032 battery powered.
- CC2540 and the electrodes were powered directly from the battery
- Amps (diff., single, RLD) and Ref gen powered with 2v generated via a REF3320

- The two dry contact electrodes were placed across the chest and the RLD wire was touching the skin on the chest.
