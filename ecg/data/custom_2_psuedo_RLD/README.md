psuedo 2-electrode ECG
----------------------

- Two 2-layer dry contact hi-z buffered electrodes were used
- In one of the electrodes, the shield ring in the bottom layer was connected to RLD
- G = 5 diff gain followed by G=100 single ended gain (total gain=500).
- ADC resolution = 12 bits
- Sampling frequency = 400 Hz
- RLD gain = 100 (or 200, check !)
- The laptop and the entire circuitry (arduino, gain board) were on the lap and isolated from the mains supply.
